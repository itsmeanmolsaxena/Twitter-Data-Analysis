# Twitter-Data-Analysis
Today we will scrape the data from One of the biggest social media platform "Twitter". We will examine the user's reaction over the Sad demise of Famous Bollywood Actor, Sushant Sigh Rajput. For Scraping the twitter data without API, we will use "GetOldTweets3" Library. It's a Python 3 library and a corresponding command line utility for accessing old tweets.

We will also use a little bit Natural Language Processing (NLP) in this project. 

For Visualization purpose, we will use WordCloud.
